<h1>Fullstack MERN Authentication</h1>
A full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to demonstrate secure user authentication, including account verification, password reset functionality, and JWT-based authentication. The project includes both a backend API for user management and a frontend user interface built with React. TailwindCSS is used for styling, and Axios is used for API requests.

<h2>Features</h2>
• User Registration & Login: Sign up and log in with secure JWT authentication. <br />
• Email Verification: Sends a 6-digit OTP to verify the user's email.<br />
• Password Reset: Allows users to reset their password using a 6-digit OTP sent to their email.<br />
• Protected Routes: Secure access to certain routes for authenticated users.<br />
• Responsive UI: Clean and modern UI built with React and styled using TailwindCSS.<br />
• API Integration: Frontend and backend communication using Axios for RESTful API calls.<br />
